## Introduction

Toxicology studies are essential for assessing the safety of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other substances. A critical parameter in these studies is the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL), which represents the highest dose at which no adverse effects are observed. Determining NOAEL values traditionally requires expert analysis of complex toxicology data, making it time-consuming and potentially subjective.

This project aims to develop a tool that leverages TxGemma, a large language model specialized for therapeutic applications, to predict NOAEL values from Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) datasets. The tool will include a frontend interface for visualizing NOAEL parameters across individual or multiple studies, providing toxicologists with a powerful aid for safety assessment.

## NOAEL Concept and Importance

### Definition and Regulatory Significance

NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) is defined as the highest tested dose of a substance that has been reported to cause no harmful (adverse) effects in a specific test species, through a specific route of administration, under specific exposure conditions. It is a key parameter in toxicological risk assessment and serves as the basis for establishing safety margins and acceptable exposure levels for humans.

Regulatory agencies like the FDA, EMA, and EPA use NOAEL values to:
- Establish acceptable daily intake (ADI) values
- Determine reference doses (RfD)
- Calculate safety/uncertainty factors
- Establish permissible exposure limits

### Determination Process

Traditional NOAEL determination involves:
1. Conducting dose-response studies in animals
2. Collecting data on various toxicological endpoints
3. Analyzing data for statistically and biologically significant adverse effects
4. Identifying the highest dose with no adverse effects

This process requires expert judgment to distinguish between adverse and non-adverse effects, considering factors such as:
- Statistical significance
- Biological relevance
- Dose-response relationships
- Historical control data
- Inter-animal variability

### Challenges in NOAEL Determination

Several challenges exist in traditional NOAEL determination:
- Subjectivity in interpreting toxicological findings
- Variability in study designs and endpoints
- Limited sample sizes in animal studies
- Difficulty in integrating data across multiple endpoints
- Time-consuming manual analysis of complex datasets

These challenges highlight the need for computational approaches that can systematically analyze toxicology data and provide consistent, objective NOAEL predictions.

## SEND Dataset Structure

### Overview of SEND

The Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) is an implementation of the CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) standard for nonclinical studies. SEND provides a standardized format for submitting animal toxicology data to regulatory agencies, particularly the FDA.

SEND organizes data into "domains," each representing a different aspect of a toxicology study. The data is typically stored in SAS Transport File (XPT) format, with each domain in a separate file.

### Key SEND Domains

The most relevant SEND domains for NOAEL prediction include:

1. **Study Design Domains**:
   - **TS (Trial Summary)**: Contains study-level parameters
   - **TA (Trial Arms)**: Defines study arms or treatment groups
   - **TX (Trial Sets)**: Defines sets of animals
   - **TE (Trial Elements)**: Defines elements of the study design

2. **Animal Data Domains**:
   - **DM (Demographics)**: Contains animal identifiers and characteristics
   - **SE (Subject Elements)**: Links subjects to trial elements

3. **Treatment Domains**:
   - **EX (Exposure)**: Contains dosing information
   - **DS (Disposition)**: Records animal status throughout the study

4. **Findings Domains**:
   - **BW (Body Weight)**: Contains body weight measurements
   - **BG (Body Weight Gain)**: Contains calculated body weight gains
   - **CL (Clinical Observations)**: Contains clinical signs
   - **LB (Laboratory Test Results)**: Contains clinical pathology data
   - **MA (Macroscopic Findings)**: Contains gross pathology findings
   - **MI (Microscopic Findings)**: Contains histopathology findings
   - **OM (Organ Measurements)**: Contains organ weight data

5. **Supplemental Domains**:
   - **SUPP--**: Contains additional information for the respective domains

### SEND Versions and Implementation

SEND has evolved through several versions:
- SENDIG 3.0 (released July 2011)
- SENDIG 3.1 (released June 2016)
- SENDIG-DART 1.1 (for developmental and reproductive toxicology)
- SENDIG-AR 1.0 (for animal rule studies)

The FDA requires SEND format for certain nonclinical studies submitted as part of NDAs, BLAs, and INDs, with specific requirements based on study start dates and submission types.

### Relevance to NOAEL Prediction

SEND datasets provide structured, standardized toxicology data that is ideal for computational analysis. Key advantages for NOAEL prediction include:

1. **Standardized Structure**: Consistent organization across studies
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes all relevant toxicology endpoints
3. **Controlled Terminology**: Uses standardized terms for findings
4. **Regulatory Acceptance**: Already used in regulatory submissions
5. **Machine-Readable Format**: Suitable for automated processing

- Hugging Face Hub (repositories: google/txgemma-27b-predict, google/txgemma-27b-chat, etc.)
- GitHub repository with supporting code and notebooks

#### Prompt Formatting
TxGemma requires specific prompt formatting for therapeutic tasks:
```python
# Example for toxicity prediction
import json
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

# Load prompt template for tasks from TDC
tdc_prompts_filepath = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="google/txgemma-27b-predict",
    filename="tdc_prompts.json",
)
with open(tdc_prompts_filepath, "r") as f:
    tdc_prompts_json = json.load(f)

# Set example TDC task and input
task_name = "Tox21_SR_p53"  # Example toxicity dataset
input_type = "{Drug SMILES}"
drug_smiles = "CN1C(=O)CN=C(C2=CCCCC2)c2cc(Cl)ccc21"  # Example molecule

# Construct prompt using template and input drug SMILES string
TDC_PROMPT = tdc_prompts_json[task_name].replace(input_type, drug_smiles)
```

#### Model Inference
Running inference with TxGemma can be done using the Transformers library:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load model directly from Hugging Face Hub
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/txgemma-27b-predict")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "google/txgemma-27b-predict",
    device_map="auto",
)

# Generate response
input_ids = tokenizer(TDC_PROMPT, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=8)
prediction = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

### Relevance to SEND Datasets and NOAEL Prediction

TxGemma's capabilities align well with the requirements for NOAEL prediction from SEND datasets:

1. **Structured Data Processing**: TxGemma can be adapted to process structured data from SEND domains relevant to toxicology assessment.

2. **Multi-endpoint Analysis**: The model can potentially analyze multiple toxicology endpoints simultaneously, which is essential for comprehensive NOAEL determination.

3. **Dose-Response Relationships**: With fine-tuning, TxGemma could learn to identify dose-response relationships critical for NOAEL identification.

4. **Explainability**: The conversational variants provide explanations for predictions, which is valuable for regulatory contexts where understanding the basis of NOAEL determinations is important.

5. **Integration with SEND Format**: TxGemma can be trained to understand the standardized structure of SEND datasets, leveraging the consistency of this format for improved predictions.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made for developing the NOAEL prediction tool:

1. **Adopt a Phased Approach**: Implement the system in phases, starting with core infrastructure and gradually adding advanced features.

2. **Leverage TxGemma-27B**: Use the larger TxGemma model for its superior accuracy and explanation capabilities, with the option to fall back to TxGemma-2B for environments with limited resources.

3. **Focus on Interpretability**: Prioritize features that explain predictions and provide confidence metrics, as these are crucial for regulatory acceptance.

4. **Implement Robust Validation**: Develop a comprehensive validation framework to compare model predictions with expert-determined NOAEL values.

5. **Consider Hybrid Approaches**: Explore combining TxGemma with traditional machine learning methods for specific aspects of the prediction pipeline.

6. **Prioritize User Experience**: Design the frontend interface with toxicologists' workflows in mind, focusing on intuitive visualization and exploration tools.

7. **Plan for Scalability**: Design the system to handle multiple studies simultaneously and accommodate future SEND versions and domains.

8. **Engage Domain Experts**: Involve toxicologists throughout the development process to ensure the tool meets their needs and aligns with regulatory requirements.

### Next Steps

To proceed with the development of the NOAEL prediction tool, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Prototype Development**: Create a prototype of the core components to validate the approach and gather feedback.

2. **Data Collection**: Gather additional SEND datasets with expert-determined NOAEL values for training and validation.

3. **Model Fine-tuning**: Experiment with fine-tuning TxGemma on toxicology data to optimize performance for NOAEL prediction.

4. **User Testing**: Conduct user testing with toxicologists to refine the frontend interface and visualization components.

5. **Regulatory Consultation**: Consult with regulatory experts to ensure the approach aligns with regulatory requirements and expectations.

6. **Documentation**: Develop comprehensive documentation for users, developers, and regulatory submissions.
